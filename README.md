# QinBoard T9 keypad IME for Android.
(fork of https://github.com/Clam-/TraditionalT9/.)

This is a Input Method Editor for Android that implements predictive text using the hardware keypad on the device. **Useless without a hardware numerical keypad.**

This fork has been specially adapted for Qin devices, but it works for any device where the backspace key is in the "back" key.
Also, this fork is with a keymap similar to that of Nokia devices, and not like the original project - where it is a Sony Ericsson keymap.

See Wiki for more information&setup guide: [QinBoard T9 keypad IME for Android](https://github.com/AshiVered/QinBoard-T9/wiki)
