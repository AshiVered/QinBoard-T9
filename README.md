This is a Input Method Editor for Android that implements predictive text using the hardware keypad on the device. **Useless without a hardware numerical keypad.**
This fork is with nokia keymap (space on 0, change lang on #...).

Supports devices with hardware keypads where Back key is also a Backspace key. Primary support, however, is only guaranteed for Qin 1s+ or Qin F21 PRO.
